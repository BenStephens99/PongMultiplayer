Client-Server multiplayer game

A two player pong game using sockets with extensions to the Java FXGL engine to create and run the game on the server side and a C++ client to render and control the game for the players.

The sever provides information to the clients regarding the ball and other players positioning, while the clients update the server with the players movement as well as rendering the game with high definition graphics and providing client side prediction to the player's bat for a smooth experience.
